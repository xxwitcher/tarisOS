TarisOS installs next to macOS with one command and starts straight into a finished desktop: the
Taris shell (bar, dock, launcher, notifications, lock screen, settings, app store), the apps you
need, and every fix Apple Silicon hardware needs on Linux. Nothing runs unless it's needed, so
the machine stays quiet, cool and long-lasting on battery.

> [!NOTE]
> TarisOS 1.0.0 is the first release and is still being tested. Back up anything important on your
> Mac before installing it.

## Features

**The desktop**

- **The Taris shell**: a bar, a dock with pinned and running apps, an app launcher and app drawer,
  notifications, a dashboard, a window overview, OSDs and a lock screen, all in one
  [Quickshell](https://quickshell.outfoxxed.me) shell.
- **Settings app** (<kbd>SUPER</kbd> + <kbd>,</kbd>): network, Bluetooth, audio, displays, power,
  keyboard and trackpad, wallpaper and colours, window style, security, updates, and a search that
  finds individual options.
- **Store**: apps from Arch Linux ARM, the TarisOS repository, Flathub and the AUR in one place.
  Browse, search, install, remove and update.
- **Colours and themes**: colour schemes, per-scheme colour changes, saved themes, and a window
  border that follows the theme. TarisOS starts with the Witcher theme.
- **Coding agent**: a terminal with your coding agent in the dashboard (<kbd>SUPER</kbd> +
  <kbd>A</kbd>), Claude Code by default (installed the first time it's opened), with skills that
  teach agents about this system.
- **Web apps**: YouTube, Discord, Kivi and Spotify are ready to use. `>install` in the launcher adds
  any site as an app, or installs a package; `>uninstall` removes either.

**The system**

- **One password, one prompt**: you log in on a screen that looks like the lock screen, and nothing
  of yours starts before that. With disk encryption, the disk password is the only one you type.
- **First-boot setup**: keyboard, Wi-Fi, time zone and your account, then straight into the
  desktop.
- **Disk encryption**: turn it on from Settings > Security at any time. The Mac restarts once and
  encrypts the disk in place.
- **Snapshots and factory reset**: a snapshot is taken before every package change (the last 10
  are kept), and Settings > Security can bring the system back to exactly how it was installed.
- **Updates in one place**: Settings > General > Updates updates the system, the TarisOS packages,
  AUR apps and Flatpak apps together.
- **Account protection**: an account locks for 10 minutes after 10 wrong passwords, and every
  password prompt says so.
- **Firewall**: nothing gets in unless it answers something your Mac started. It's a static
  ruleset, so nothing keeps running.
- **Low power**: no background services that aren't needed, compressed swap in RAM, hardware video
  decoding, power profiles in the bar's battery menu, and an optional 80% charge limit (Settings >
  Power).

**Apple Silicon hardware**

- Speakers and microphones with Asahi's sound processing, including a fix for apps that only heard
  the microphone on one side
- Wi-Fi that recovers after sleep, with the right Wi-Fi channels for your country
- Trackpad and keyboard reliable from the first second
- Hardware video decoding
- Fan control in the bar
- Touch Bar with media, brightness and screenshot keys (MacBook Pros that have one)

**Default apps**

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Browser | Chromium (with Google account sign-in and sync) |
| Terminal | kitty |
| Files | Nautilus, with Space-bar previews |
| Text editor | GNOME Text Editor, Neovim |

Chinese, Japanese and Korean input and fonts are installed when you turn them on in Settings >
General > Language & region.

## Supported Macs

TarisOS is made for the Apple Silicon Macs Asahi Linux supports: the **M1** and **M2** families.
It's developed and tested on an M1 MacBook Pro; M2 Macs haven't been tested yet. TarisOS is for
Apple Silicon only: it carries no drivers or firmware for other hardware.

## Installation

You need:

- an M1 or M2 Mac running **macOS 13.5 or newer**;
- free disk space for TarisOS (the installer asks how much to give it; 30 GB or more is
  comfortable);
- an internet connection while installing;
- a backup of anything important on the Mac.

**1. Run the installer in macOS.** Open Terminal and run:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/xxwitcher/tarisOS/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sh
```

This starts the Asahi Linux installer with TarisOS as the system to install. It asks for your
macOS password, how much space to give TarisOS (macOS keeps the rest), and the name the Mac's
startup screen shows. It then downloads TarisOS and installs it next to macOS. Nothing in macOS is
changed apart from its partition shrinking.

**2. Allow TarisOS to start.** Apple requires this step for every other operating system. When the
installer says so, shut the Mac down, then press and hold the power button until "Loading startup
options" appears. Choose TarisOS and follow the installer's instructions; it asks for your macOS
password to confirm.

**3. Set up TarisOS.** TarisOS starts with its setup screen: choose your keyboard, join a Wi-Fi
network (you can skip it), pick your time zone and create your account. Then you're on your
desktop.

To switch between macOS and TarisOS, hold the power button while the Mac starts and pick one.

## Using TarisOS

### Shortcuts

| Keys | Action |
| --- | --- |
| <kbd>SUPER</kbd> + <kbd>SPACE</kbd> | App launcher |
| <kbd>SUPER</kbd> + <kbd>RETURN</kbd> | Terminal |
| <kbd>SUPER</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd> | Browser |
| <kbd>SUPER</kbd> + <kbd>E</kbd> | Files |
| <kbd>SUPER</kbd> + <kbd>,</kbd> | Settings |
| <kbd>SUPER</kbd> + <kbd>TAB</kbd> or <kbd>SUPER</kbd> + <kbd>`</kbd> | Window overview |
| <kbd>SUPER</kbd> + <kbd>N</kbd> | Notification sidebar |
| <kbd>SUPER</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd> | Coding agent |
| <kbd>SUPER</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd> | Clipboard history |
| <kbd>SUPER</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd> | Lock |
| <kbd>SUPER</kbd> + <kbd>ESC</kbd> | Session menu (log out, restart, shut down) |
| <kbd>PRINT</kbd> | Screenshot |
| <kbd>SUPER</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> | Record a part of the screen |
| <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>Q</kbd> or <kbd>SUPER</kbd> + <kbd>W</kbd> | Close the window |
| <kbd>SUPER</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> | Fullscreen |
| <kbd>SUPER</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> | Maximise |
| <kbd>SUPER</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> | Minimise to the dock |
| <kbd>SUPER</kbd> + <kbd>T</kbd> | Float or tile the window |
| <kbd>SUPER</kbd> + arrows | Move focus |
| <kbd>SUPER</kbd> + <kbd>1</kbd>–<kbd>9</kbd> | Go to a workspace |
| <kbd>SUPER</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>1</kbd>–<kbd>9</kbd> | Move the window to a workspace |
| 3-finger swipe left or right | Switch workspace |
| 3-finger swipe up or down | Open or close the overview |

The left <kbd>CTRL</kbd> and <kbd>SUPER</kbd> keys are swapped, so <kbd>⌘</kbd> works as it does
in macOS (<kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> copies, <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>Q</kbd> closes) and the
<kbd>SUPER</kbd> shortcuts are on the <kbd>control</kbd> key. Settings > Keyboard & trackpad
changes this.

### Apps and updates

- **Install apps** from the Store (in the launcher), or type `>install` in the launcher.
- **Update** from Settings > General > Updates. TarisOS takes a snapshot first, then updates the
  system, its own packages, AUR apps and Flatpak apps.
- **Remove an app** with `>uninstall` in the launcher, or Remove… in the app drawer.

From a terminal, TarisOS is Arch Linux ARM: `pacman`, `yay` and `flatpak` work as usual. Install
with `sudo pacman -Syu --needed <package>` (never `-Sy` alone), and update everything with
`/usr/lib/taris/update`.

### Security, encryption and factory reset

All in Settings > Security:

- **Disk encryption**: choose *Encrypt the disk*, enter your password, and the Mac restarts. On the
  way back up it asks for a new disk password twice, encrypts the disk (it shows how far it has
  got), and starts. From then on the disk password is your login.
- **Factory reset**: *Erase everything* (click twice) restarts and brings TarisOS back to how it
  was installed. Every account and file on it is erased, and the setup screen starts again.

Snapshots taken before package changes are listed with `sudo snapper list`.

### Wallpapers

Wallpapers are read from `~/Pictures/Wallpapers`, where `TarisOS` holds the ones TarisOS comes with.
Pick one in Settings > Appearance > Wallpaper & style, or run `taris wallpaper -f <path>`.

### Your own Hyprland settings

Hyprland's settings come from `/usr/share/taris/hypr/` and update with the system. Put your own
changes in `~/.config/hypr/user.lua`, which loads last, or use the Window style, Displays and
Keyboard & trackpad pages in Settings.

### The shell from a terminal

```sh
taris shell -d       # start the shell (it starts with Hyprland)
taris shell -l       # its log
taris shell -s       # every IPC command, e.g.:
taris shell mpris getActive trackTitle
```

## Building TarisOS

TarisOS is built on an Apple Silicon Mac running Arch Linux ARM (Asahi Linux): its own package
repository first, then the installer image from it. Everything goes into `distro/out/`.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/xxwitcher/tarisOS.git
cd tarisOS

distro/make-signing-key.sh      # once: the key packages are signed with (back it up)
distro/build-repo.sh            # build and sign every package, and the package list
sudo distro/build-image.sh      # the installer image, from that repository
```

- `distro/build-repo.sh` builds this repository's packages (`packaging/pkgbuilds/`) and VS Code,
  NordVPN and yay from the AUR (a changed AUR PKGBUILD is shown for review first). It installs the
  build tools it needs, and keeps the source of every package built from source in
  `distro/out/sources` (the GPL asks for it next to the binaries).
- `distro/build-image.sh` makes `distro/out/images/tarisos.zip` in the format the Asahi Linux
  installer installs, with `installer_data.json` and `install.sh` (the command that starts the
  installer).

Publishing (`distro/config.sh` sets where):

- **Packages**: upload everything in `distro/out/repo` to the release `packages` of
  [tarisOS-packages](https://github.com/xxwitcher/tarisOS-packages), with
  `taris.db`, `taris.files` and their `.sig` files as copies of the `.tar.gz` files of the same name
  (release assets can't be links).
- **Image**: publish a TarisOS release on this repository (e.g. `v1.0.0`, not marked as a
  pre-release) with `tarisos.zip`, `installer_data.json` and `install.sh` from `distro/out/images`
  (GitHub takes files under 2 GB). The install command always runs the latest release's
  `install.sh`.

## Working on the shell

To work on the shell and the desktop on an existing Asahi Linux (Arch Linux ARM) install:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/xxwitcher/tarisOS.git
cd tarisOS
./install.sh
```

`install.sh` builds the shell and the packages it needs from this checkout and installs them,
together with TarisOS's desktop settings (`taris-desktop`, `taris-chromium`, `taris-wallpapers`).
It then restarts the shell and checks that it loaded. Run it again after every change. The login
screen, hardware fixes, snapshots and firewall come only with the TarisOS image.

## Configuration

Most options are in the Settings app (<kbd>SUPER</kbd> + <kbd>,</kbd>). All of them, including the ones
Settings doesn't show, live in `~/.config/taris/shell.json`. Options you leave out use their default values.

### Per-monitor configuration

You can configure per-monitor options in `~/.config/taris/monitors/<monitor_name>/shell.json`.
List the names of your available monitors by running:

```sh
hyprctl monitors -j | jq -r '.[].name'
```

Options set in these files will **override** the respective options in the global config. Any options not present in
per-monitor configs will inherit their values from the global config.


For example, to automatically hide the bar on the monitor named `DP-1`:

**`~/.config/taris/monitors/DP-1/shell.json`**

```json
{
    "bar": {
        "persistent": false
    }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Not all options respect per-monitor overrides. Most notably, the following options will only read
> from the global config, and ignore the respective option in per-monitor config files.
>
> <details><summary>Ignored options</summary>
>
> - `appearance`: `anim.*`, `transparency.*`
> - `bar.tray`: `hiddenIcons`, `iconSubs`
> - `bar.workspaces`: `ignoredTags`, `specialWorkspaceIcons`, `windowIcons`, `workspaceIcons`
> - `dashboard`: `mediaUpdateInterval`, `resourceUpdateInterval`
> - `general`: `apps.*`, `battery.*`, `idle.*`, `logo`
> - `launcher`: `actionPrefix`, `actions`, `enableDangerousActions`, `favouriteApps`, `hiddenApps`, `specialPrefix`, `useFuzzy.*`, `vimKeybinds`
> - `lock`: `enableFprint`, `enableHowdy`, `maxFprintTries`, `maxHowdyTries`, `triggerHowdyOnWake`
> - `nexus`: `networkRescanInterval`
> - `notifs`: `actionOnClick`, `defaultExpireTimeout`, `expire`, `fullscreen`, `fullscreenExpireTimeout`
> - `paths`: `lyricsDir`, `wallpaperDir`
> - `services`: `audioIncrement`, `brightnessIncrement`, `clockFormat`, `dataUnits`, `defaultPlayer`, `gpuType`, `lyricsBackend`, `maxVolume`, `playerAliases`, `sensorUnits`, `smartScheme`, `visualiserBars`, `weatherLocation`, `weatherUnits`
> - `utilities`: `toasts.*`, `vpn.*`
>
> </details>

### Example configuration

> [!WARNING]
> The example configuration includes **ALL** configuration options in `shell.json`. It is
> **not** recommended to copy and paste this entire configuration into `shell.json`,
> as options or their default values may change across updates, resulting in a stale config.
>
> This is meant to serve as a reference of all the available options, and you should
> <ins>only add the ones you want to change</ins> to `shell.json`.

### Advanced configuration

> [!CAUTION]
> Do NOT change any of these options unless you know what you are doing. These options control the
> tokens used internally within the shell, and can cause visual issues if modified incorrectly.
> The available options may change or be removed without notice across versions.

A separate `~/.config/taris/shell-tokens.json` file allows editing the internal tokens without
touching the source code of the shell. These tokens affect the dimensions and appearance of visual elements,
including individual rounding, spacing, padding, font size, animation durations and curves, and the sizes of
certain components. The appearance scale values in `shell.json` are multiplied against these base
token values to produce the final computed values.

Per-monitor token overrides are also available at
`~/.config/taris/monitors/<monitor_name>/shell-tokens.json`.

## Credits

The Taris shell is a heavily modified version of the
[Caelestia shell](https://github.com/caelestia-dots/shell) by
[@soramanew](https://github.com/soramanew) and its contributors. Much of its code is Caelestia's,
renamed and reworked for TarisOS. The `taris` command-line tool is built from
[Caelestia's CLI](https://github.com/caelestia-dots/cli). Thank you to the Caelestia project;
TarisOS isn't affiliated with it.

TarisOS is built on [Asahi Linux](https://asahilinux.org/) and
[Arch Linux ARM](https://archlinuxarm.org/), with [Quickshell](https://quickshell.outfoxxed.me) by
[@outfoxxed](https://github.com/outfoxxed) and [Hyprland](https://hypr.land).

Thanks to Naeem and the [Omarchy-Mac](https://github.com/omarchy-mac/omarchy-mac) project, whose
installer showed which fixes Apple Silicon Macs need and how to apply them safely.
