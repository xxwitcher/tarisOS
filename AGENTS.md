# Task Guides

Deeper instructions for specific kinds of work live in `agents/skills/`. Read the matching guide before starting:

- [`agents/skills/shell-dev.md`](agents/skills/shell-dev.md) - editing the Taris shell under `shell/` (QML, the C++ plugin, its helper scripts)
- [`agents/skills/packaging.md`](agents/skills/packaging.md) - working under `packaging/` (PKGBUILDs, the helpers in `/usr/lib/taris`, pacman hooks, install scripts, the Hyprland config TarisOS ships)
- [`agents/skills/upgrades.md`](agents/skills/upgrades.md) - changing something on machines that are already installed
- [`agents/skills/distro-image.md`](agents/skills/distro-image.md) - working under `distro/` (the package repository, the installer image, the macOS install command) and testing whole installs
- [`agents/skills/visual-verification.md`](agents/skills/visual-verification.md) - verifying any change with a visual effect in the running UI
- [`agents/skills/icons.md`](agents/skills/icons.md) - adding or changing icons, logos and brand marks

# Working Rules

These are the maintainer's rules. They come before everything else in this file.

- Do exactly what is asked: nothing less, nothing more. Never add behaviour, restrictions or "while I'm here" changes nobody asked for. When something is unclear, ask, but first re-read the conversation: never ask what the maintainer already answered.
- No git commands at all (not even `git status`, `git log` or `git diff`) unless the maintainer explicitly says so for that step. When asked to commit: atomic commits (one coherent change each), with succinct messages that describe the change.
- Find causes from evidence before changing anything: logs (`taris shell -l`, `journalctl`), live state (`hyprctl -j clients`, `hyprctl getoption`), the source of Hyprland and Quickshell at the exact versions installed, and the maintainer's screenshots and recordings. Do not ship guesses; say plainly when something is still unexplained.
- No explanation text in the UI: labels and controls only.
- Shell features are core distro components: trace focus grabs, layers, keyboard focus, timing and edge cases, and reread the whole file before handing a change over.
- The development machine is itself a TarisOS install and the maintainer's own desktop. Do not kill or restart the shell or Hyprland, remove packages or delete large things without saying so first; hand over the command when a step needs the maintainer's password, or run it with `pkexec` so the prompt appears on their screen.
- Code for TarisOS on plain Asahi Linux only. Nothing for other hardware.
- Every new source file starts with the copyright and licence header the existing files carry (`Copyright (C) 2026 George Dobreff ("Witcher") and contributors`, `SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-only`).
- Keep the maintainer's distro plan (`~/Downloads/DISTRO-PLAN.md`, when present) updated with every decision.
- `/tmp` is RAM: no big builds there. Use the git-ignored `shell/build/` or a package's own folder.

# Documentation Layout

Documentation is split by genre and audience:

- `agents/skills/` - task procedure ("do this when doing X"), for anyone working on the codebase
- `README.md` - the user manual and the build instructions, published; never codebase internals beyond the repository layout
- `packaging/agents/skills/` - skills for the coding agents of TarisOS users (installed by `taris-desktop`): end-user customization of an installed system, never TarisOS development
- the distro plan (see Working Rules) - decisions, the state of the distro and how its parts work

# Style

- In markdown documents, wrap lines at 100 columns as the existing documents do; break earlier only at structural boundaries like headings and list items.
- Indentation follows the file: tabs in the scripts under `packaging/pkgbuilds/` and `distro/`, four spaces in TarisOS's own PKGBUILDs (`taris*`) and in QML, C++ and Python, two spaces in the scripts at the repository root and under `shell/assets/`. PKGBUILDs based on other people's keep their own. Never mix them in one file.
- Use bash conditionals: `[[ ]]` for string and file tests and `(( ))` for numeric tests.
- In `[[ ]]`, don't quote variables, but do quote string literals when comparing values (e.g. `[[ $mode == "auto" ]]`).
- Prefer `(( ))` over numeric operators inside `[[ ]]` (e.g. `(( count < 50 ))`, not `[[ $count -lt 50 ]]`).
- Prefer a full `if`/`else` for simple two-path control flow; don't rely on `exec` or `exit` in one branch to make the following statements unreachable.
- Quote strings and paths with spaces instead of escaping the spaces.
- Shebangs: `#!/bin/bash` for bash (never `#!/usr/bin/env bash`); `#!/bin/sh` only for scripts that must stay POSIX (the greeter's, run before anything of the user's), `#!/usr/bin/ash` for initramfs hooks, `#!/usr/bin/python3 -I` for root helpers in Python.
- Python runs isolated (`python3 -I`), from the shell and from scripts.
- Comments say why, in plain sentences; every script and helper starts with the header and a comment saying what it does, who runs it and its usage lines.
- British spelling in the shell's names and text (`Colours`, `colour`), as the code already has.

# Naming

Everything is `taris`: packages are `taris-*`, helpers are `/usr/lib/taris/<name>`, shared data is `/usr/share/taris/`, the shell is installed to `/etc/xdg/quickshell/taris` and runs on `quickshell-taris` as `taris-qs`, its QML modules are `Taris.*` and its global shortcuts `taris:<name>`. Per-user files are `~/.config/taris/`, `~/.local/state/taris/` and `~/.cache/taris/`.

Links to the old repositories (`caelestia-dots/*`, `xxwitcher/caelestia-silicon`), the upstream CLI tarball, `shell/NOTICE` and the README's credits keep their names on purpose.

# Runtime Environment

- The shell finds its own files through `Quickshell.shellDir` / `Quickshell.shellPath()` and the `Paths` singleton (`shell/utils/Paths.qml`); never hard-code `/etc/xdg/quickshell/taris` in QML.
- Helpers and packaged scripts use their absolute installed paths (`/usr/lib/taris/...`, `/usr/share/taris/...`).
- Hyprland's config is Lua: TarisOS's is `/usr/share/taris/hypr/hyprland.lua` and `taris.lua` (from `packaging/hypr/`), loaded by each account's `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.lua` stub, with the account's own `user.lua` last.

# Privileged Commands

Follow the "Privilege Escalation" section of `packaging/agents/skills/asahi-desktop/SKILL.md`, and the repo's own code follows it too: `sudo` when the caller has a terminal to enter a password in, `pkexec` when it does not. The shell is the session's polkit agent (`shell/modules/polkit/`). An account locks for 10 minutes after 10 failed passwords: never retry a failing one.

# Helper Commands

Use these instead of reimplementing what they do:

- `/usr/lib/taris/update` - update everything (repositories, AUR, Flatpak)
- `/usr/lib/taris/install-on-demand <app>` - install an app that is installed on first use, then open it
- `/usr/lib/taris/input-method add|remove zh|ja|ko` - CJK typing
- `/usr/lib/taris/user-defaults [--if-new]` - a new account's defaults
- `/usr/lib/taris/chromium-flags` - Chromium's settings for the account
- `/usr/lib/taris/build-hyprbars [--check|--force]` - the title bar plugin for the installed Hyprland
- `taris` (the CLI: `scheme`, `wallpaper`, `screenshot`, `record`, `shell`) and `taris-qs -c taris ipc call <target> <function>`
- `notify-send -a TarisOS` for notifications from scripts

Commands installed by TarisOS's own packages and the default apps (`distro/image/scripts/40-taris.sh`) are runtime invariants. Invoke them directly; do not add defensive `command -v` checks around them. Check only for genuinely optional programs (`fprintd`, `wtype`, an agent the user hasn't installed) or code that can run before the packages are installed (`install.sh`, the image build).

# Settings App

- The pages are listed in `shell/modules/nexus/PageRegistry.qml` and built in `shell/modules/nexus/PageCompRegistry.qml`, in the same order; keep both in step.
- `shell/modules/nexus/SettingsIndex.qml` is generated by `shell/scripts/settings-index.py` (`install.sh` and `distro/build-repo.sh` run it). Never edit it by hand; run the script after changing a page's options.

# Config Structure

- `packaging/hypr/` - the Hyprland config every account loads (installed by `taris-desktop`)
- `packaging/defaults/` - the Taris theme and the preinstalled web apps
- `shell/plugin/src/Taris/Config/*.hpp` - the shell's config options and their defaults (`~/.config/taris/shell.json` overrides them); a changed default needs the plugin rebuilt
- `packaging/pkgbuilds/taris-desktop/user-defaults` - what a new account starts with

# Tests

There is no automated test suite yet. Until there is one, run the checks for the area you changed, and report their output; [`agents/skills/shell-dev.md`](agents/skills/shell-dev.md) and [`agents/skills/packaging.md`](agents/skills/packaging.md) list them. The shell's own checkers (`shell/scripts/qml-lint-conventions.py`, `shell/scripts/trs-check.py`) already report problems in files nobody touched: run them on the files you changed (`--file`), and leave none of your own.

Run anything that touches an account's files against a throwaway home, never the maintainer's (see [`agents/skills/upgrades.md`](agents/skills/upgrades.md)).

Visual changes must be verified in the running UI in addition to these checks; follow [`agents/skills/visual-verification.md`](agents/skills/visual-verification.md). Whole-install changes (login, setup screen, encryption, factory reset, the image) need a fresh image; see [`agents/skills/distro-image.md`](agents/skills/distro-image.md).

# Refresh Pattern

- An account's Hyprland stub: `./install-hypr.sh` (keeps a backup of an existing `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.lua`).
- An account's agent skills: `./install-agent-skills.sh`.
- The shell and the desktop packages from this checkout on the development machine: `./install.sh` (it restarts the shell: say so before running it).
