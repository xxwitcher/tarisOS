# TarisOS's package signing key, made once in your own GnuPG keyring on the machine that builds
# the repository (GnuPG asks for a passphrase to protect it). Its public half goes into
# packaging/pkgbuilds/taris-keyring, which installed systems trust it through. Run it again to
# re-export an existing key. Back up the private key (the command is printed at the end): losing it
# means every installed system has to be told to trust a new one.
