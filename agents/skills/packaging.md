# Packaging

Read this before working under `packaging/`: the PKGBUILDs, the helpers they install to
`/usr/lib/taris`, pacman hooks, install scripts, the Hyprland config, the defaults and the agent
skills TarisOS ships.

TarisOS is configuration as packages: every fix or default is a file owned by a pacman package, so
updates reach installed machines and removing the package undoes it. The image installs the
`taris` meta package and the default apps; nothing else configures the system.

## Where things go

- `packaging/pkgbuilds/<package>/` - one folder per package: its PKGBUILD and the files it
  installs. `taris-shell`, `taris-desktop` and `taris-wallpapers` also read files from the
  repository itself (`$startdir/../..`: `shell/`, `packaging/hypr/`, `packaging/defaults/`,
  `packaging/agents/skills/`, `packaging/wallpapers/`).
- Which package owns what: hardware fixes in `taris-hardware`, the login, greeter, setup screen and
  disk encryption in `taris-login`, Hyprland's config, a new account's defaults and the system's
  name in `taris-desktop`, snapshots and factory reset in `taris-snapshots`, Chromium's settings in
  `taris-chromium`. Packages built only because Arch Linux ARM lacks them sit next to them;
  `distro/config.sh` lists every package in build order.
- System-wide defaults go where programs read them for every account (`/etc/xdg/...`,
  `/usr/share/taris/...`), not into home folders. Only what can't work that way goes into
  `user-defaults` (see [`upgrades.md`](upgrades.md)).
- Root-scoped hardware setup belongs to `taris-hardware`; per-account setup to `taris-desktop`'s
  `user-defaults`. Keep it clear what runs as root and what runs for each account.

## Rules

- Bump `pkgrel` whenever a package's content changes (the version is `1.0.0`; `pkgver` changes
  with a release). Installed machines only update when the version goes up. One bump per release
  of the package is enough: don't bump again for further changes before it is published.
- After changing any file in a package's `source=()`: `updpkgsums` in its folder.
- Files an administrator may edit go in `backup=()`.
- Services that are always on are enabled by the package itself (a `*.wants/` link in the
  package), so there is no enabling step to forget and nothing left behind on removal.
- Hooks: name them for what they do, order them with a numeric prefix where order matters
  (`00-` before, `zz-` after other hooks), and make their command a no-op on a machine where its
  precondition is missing.
- Install scripts (`*.install`): idempotent, safe to run on every upgrade; `post_upgrade` usually
  calls `post_install`.
- Dependencies: everything a package's files run is in `depends=()`; programs that are optional
  for it go in `optdepends=()`. A missing dependency only shows on a fresh install, never on the
  development machine (which has everything), so check new commands against the package.
- Every helper in `/usr/lib/taris` starts with the copyright header and a comment saying what it
  does, who runs it (a service, a hook, Settings through `pkexec`…) and its usage lines, as the
  existing helpers do. Root helpers run through `pkexec` validate every argument and refuse what
  they don't expect.
- Raw `pacman`, `command -v` and `pacman-key` are fine in package and build tooling, where direct
  package-manager behaviour is the point.

## Checks before handing over

- Shell scripts `bash -n` (initramfs hooks `sh -n`), Lua `luac -p`, Python `ast.parse`,
  nftables in a throwaway namespace (`unshare -rn nft -f <file>`).
- Build the package: `makepkg -f -c` in its folder (`-d` to skip installed-dependency checks).
  Look inside the result (`bsdtar -tf` for the file list, `bsdtar -xOf <pkg> <path>` for a file)
  to confirm it carries the change. The package file is git-ignored; delete it when done unless
  the maintainer is testing it.
- Test on the development machine by installing the build: `pkexec pacman -U <package file>`
  (the password prompt appears on the maintainer's screen). Then check the effect where it applies:
  `hyprctl configerrors` and `hyprctl getoption` for Hyprland's config, the service's status for a
  unit, the running program for its config.
- For a script that writes into a home folder, run it against a throwaway home first
  ([`upgrades.md`](upgrades.md) shows how).
