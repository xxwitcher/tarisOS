# Taris Skill

This machine runs TarisOS (Arch Linux ARM on Apple Silicon, Asahi Linux) with Hyprland and
**Taris** as its desktop shell. For Hyprland, terminals, packages and the rest of the system, see
the asahi-desktop skill.

Taris is a Quickshell shell (package `taris-shell`, from the TarisOS repository). The same shell
is the login screen (the greeter, before anyone has logged in) and the first-boot setup screen.

## Critical Safety Rules

- **Never edit the installed shell** in `/etc/xdg/quickshell/taris/` (package
  `taris-shell`), or the `taris` CLI in `/usr/lib/python3*/site-packages/taris/`.
  Reading them is fine. Package updates overwrite them.
- **Never run `taris install` or `taris update`.** They deploy upstream Taris's dotfiles,
  which replace this setup.
- Changing the shell's own code is development, not customization: it happens in TarisOS's
  source (https://github.com/xxwitcher/tarisOS), never in the installed files. Only when
  the user asks for it.
- Files under `~/.config/taris/` that say "Written by Taris settings" are generated: change
  them through the settings app (or the JSON they're written from), not by hand.
- Restarting the shell (`taris shell -r`) closes every panel and briefly removes the bar. Config
  changes reload on their own, so only restart when a change really needs it, and say so first.
- Back up a config file before editing it: `cp file file.bak.$(date +%s)`.
- For privileged work, use `sudo` when a terminal is available for the password prompt, `pkexec`
  when it is not.

## Files

```

├── shell.json              # Shell config: bar, dock entry, launcher, notifications, idle, appearance...

├── theme-border.conf       # Generated: the scheme's border colours (used while bordertheme=1)
├── colour-overrides.json   # Colours page: per-scheme colour overrides {"name flavour mode": {colour: hex}}
├── hypr-settings.json      # Displays and Keyboard pages (monitors, input options) ...
└── hypr-settings.lua       #   ... and the Lua generated from it (don't edit)

~/.local/state/taris/
├── scheme.json             # Current colour scheme, written by the `taris` CLI (don't edit)
├── dock.json               # Pinned dock apps and the dock's Settings/apps/Trash buttons
└── notifs.json             # Saved notifications
```

Wallpapers are read from `~/Pictures/Wallpapers` (one folder per category; `TarisOS` links to the
wallpapers TarisOS comes with, `/usr/share/backgrounds/taris`).

## Settings App

`SUPER + COMMA` (or `taris-qs -c taris ipc call nexus open`) opens Taris's settings as an
overlay. Prefer pointing the user there for things it covers: wallpaper and colours, window style,
network, Bluetooth, audio, displays, power and idle, lock screen, keyboard and trackpad, panels,
dock, default apps, notifications.

## Commands

```bash
taris shell -d                    # Start the shell (detached)
taris shell -r                    # Kill and restart it (see the safety rules)
taris shell -l                    # Print the shell log: check it after config changes
taris shell -s                    # List every IPC target and function
taris-qs -c taris ipc call <target> <function> [args]
```

Useful IPC targets: `drawers` (toggle launcher, dashboard, sidebar...), `lock` (lock, unlock),
`notifs` (clear, toggleDnd), `wallpaper` (get, set, list), `brightness` (get, set "10%+"...),
`mpris` (playPause, next, previous), `idleInhibitor`, `gameMode`, `overview`, `picker`
(screenshot region picker), `nexus` (open settings).

Hyprland binds the shell's global shortcuts as `hl.dsp.global("taris:<name>")`, with these names:
launcher, dashboard, sidebar, session, utilities, showall, overview, overviewOpen, overviewClose,
nexus, agent, lock, unlock, clearNotifs, screenshot, screenshotClip, screenshotFreeze,
screenshotFreezeClip, brightnessUp, brightnessDown, mediaToggle, mediaNext, mediaPrev, mediaStop,
mediaSwitch, refreshDevices.

## Colours, Themes and Wallpaper

The shell's colour scheme (and the colours the `taris` CLI writes for terminals, Hyprland,
GTK, Qt, btop, fuzzel and others) comes from the `taris` CLI:

```bash
taris scheme list                         # Schemes and flavours (JSON)
taris scheme get                          # Current scheme
taris scheme set -n gruvbox -f soft       # Pick a scheme and flavour
taris scheme set -m light                 # Light or dark
taris scheme set -n dynamic               # Colours from the wallpaper
taris wallpaper -f <image>                # Set the wallpaper
```

Single colours of a scheme are changed on the Colours page (Settings > Wallpaper & style >
Colours), which keeps them per scheme in `colour-overrides.json`.

The window border gradient follows the scheme while `bordertheme=1` in `window-style.conf`; picking
border colours on the Window style page turns that off, picking a scheme turns it back on.

## Hyprland Integration

`/usr/share/taris/hypr/taris.lua` (package-owned) adds the shell's layer rules, keybindings,
gestures, window style and settings to Hyprland. It is loaded near the end of TarisOS's Hyprland
config (`/usr/share/taris/hypr/hyprland.lua`, which `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.lua` loads), just
before `~/.config/hypr/user.lua`. Personal Hyprland changes go in `user.lua`, which loads last and
so wins over Taris's (see the asahi-desktop skill).

After any Hyprland change: `hyprctl reload`, then `hyprctl configerrors` until it is clean.

### Keybindings Taris adds

| Keys | Action |
|------|--------|
| `SUPER + SPACE` | App launcher |
| `SUPER + GRAVE` | Window overview (also 3-finger swipe up; swipe down closes it) |
| `SUPER + N` | Notification sidebar |
| `SUPER + COMMA` | Settings |
| `SUPER + A` | Default coding agent in a terminal |
| `SUPER + M` | Minimize the window to the dock |
| `CTRL + Q` | Close the window |
| 3-finger horizontal swipe | Switch workspace (window style `swipe=1`) |

TarisOS's Hyprland config adds the rest (terminal, browser, files, workspaces, window keys, media
keys); see the asahi-desktop skill. Left Ctrl and left Super are swapped unless the Keyboard page
says otherwise.

## Idle and Lock

Idle actions are `general.idle.timeouts` in `shell.json` (a list of `{ "timeout": seconds,
"idleAction": "lock" | "dpms off" | [command...], "returnAction": ... }`), also on Settings > Power.
Lock now: `taris-qs -c taris ipc call lock lock`.

## Screenshots and Recording

```bash
taris screenshot                  # Full screen
taris screenshot -r               # Pick a region (-f freezes the screen while picking)
taris record                      # Start/stop recording the screen (-r region, -s with sound)
taris record -p                   # Pause/resume
```

Recordings and their list are also in the quick actions panel (bottom right).

## Dock

Pinned apps are in `~/.local/state/taris/dock.json` and on Settings > Dock. In the dock, drag
apps to rearrange them, drag from the app drawer to pin, drop on the Trash to unpin; right click
for an app's menu.

## Touch Bar

On MacBooks with a Touch Bar, `tiny-dfr` draws it from `/etc/tiny-dfr/config.toml` (from the
`taris-hardware` package: a pacman update keeps your edits and leaves its own next to them as
`.pacnew`). Edit with sudo, then `sudo systemctl restart tiny-dfr`.

## Troubleshooting

- Shell misbehaving after a config edit: `taris shell -l` shows the QML warnings and errors.
- A setting not applying to Hyprland: `hyprctl configerrors`, and check `window-style.conf` and
  `hypr-settings.json`.
- Colours stuck: `taris scheme get`, then set the scheme again.
